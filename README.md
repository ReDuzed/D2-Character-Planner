# Offline Character Planner
## Released version: v0.1 (alpha)

The scope of this project is to create an alternative to the type of projects using spreadsheets to calculate values like @res, magic find, and FCR from items into a quick reference. Something of note is that each item needs to be added manually, but the database outputs a text file with all the data that can be redistributed and used universally. The same goes for each of the character gear loadouts.
